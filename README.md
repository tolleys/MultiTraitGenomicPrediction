# Multi-trait Genomic Prediction of Grain Yield using Yield Components

Within this repository, we are sharing R scripts used in the analysis for Genetic Parameters and Multi-trait Genomic Prediction of Grain Yield on a Plot and Ear Basis in Temperate and Tropical Maize.

In this analysis single- and multi-trait genomic prediction was performed in various R scripts.
